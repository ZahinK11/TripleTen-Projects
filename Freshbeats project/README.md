# 🎧 Fresh Beats Business Intelligence Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

**Sprint 0: Welcome Sprint – A First Look at Business Analytics**

This project represents my first hands-on Business Intelligence (BI) report, completed as part of TripleTen’s Data Analytics program. I applied analytical thinking to assess real-world business challenges faced by **Fresh Beats**, a dynamic music streaming platform that promotes emerging musicians while generating revenue from artist promotions.

Using provided data insights and visualizations, I compiled a stakeholder-friendly report that translates raw analytics into strategic recommendations. This project emphasizes insight selection, storytelling, and business-focused interpretation—key skills for a BI Analyst.
